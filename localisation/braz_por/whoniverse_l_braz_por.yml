With a strict hierarchy and advanced technology, these evolved Daleks are designed for absolute extermination of all inferior life forms. Led by the Supreme Dalek, they seek to expand their empire and assert dominance across the universe."

 START_SCREEN_WHONIVERSE_DALEK1:0 "From the depths of history, the Daleks emerged as a relentless force, forged by war and driven by an unyielding will to conquer. Born on the ravaged planet of Skaro, the Daleks' survival is a testament to their indomitable spirit. Under the rule of the Dalek Emperor, the self-proclaimed 'God of all Daleks' and one of the few survivors of the Last Great Time War, the Dalek Empire stands on the precipice of resurgence.\n\nIn the aftermath of the devastating war, where even their creator Davros seemingly perished, the Dalek Emperor has led its subjects in restoring Skaro to its former glory. The planet, once a desolate wasteland, is being transformed into a beacon of power and efficiency, embodying the Dalek ideals of order and supremacy.\n\nWith their planet reborn and their resolve unshaken, the Daleks now turn their gaze to the stars. Armed with advanced technology and a ruthless determination, they seek to expand their dominion across the galaxy. Every world they encounter will be faced with a simple choice - submission or extermination. The galaxy will tremble as the Dalek Empire rises once more, led by the vision and might of the Dalek Emperor!"
 
 START_SCREEN_WHONIVERSE_NEW_DALEK_PARADIGM:0 "From the ashes of defeat, the New Dalek Paradigm rises, a revitalized force born from the embers of the Last Great Time War and a cunning plan executed on Earth. Disguised as "Ironsides" during World War II, the Daleks manipulated Winston Churchill's war effort until the Doctor's intervention activated their Progenitor device. This device confirmed their purity, leading to the creation of a new, more powerful breed of Daleks.\n\nCharacterized by vibrant colors and a strict hierarchy, the New Dalek Paradigm epitomizes Dalek evolution, designed to exterminate all inferior life forms and reclaim their supremacy in the universe. Having survived near annihilation, they are driven by an unquenchable thirst for conquest and retribution, proving that the Daleks are an indomitable force destined to dominate the cosmos.\n\nAs they expand their influence across the stars, the New Dalek Paradigm is establishing the foundations of a new Dalek Parliament. Under the leadership of the Dalek Supreme, they will eradicate any opposition, laying the groundwork for their empire. The universe will tremble before their might as the era of the New Dalek Paradigm begins."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_cybermanempire:0 "Cyberiad"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_cybermanempire_desc:0 "Once a mighty empire across space and time, the Cyberiad was reduced to a single world after its defeat. However, it is only a matter of time before it grows again and gives birth to a realm that will survive until the end of universe itself."

 START_SCREEN_WHONIVERSE_CYBERMAN1:0 "Across the vast expanse of the universe, the Cybermen emerged as a formidable force, their origins tracing back to parallel worlds and divergent evolutionary paths. On multiple planets, the convergence of necessity and technological ambition gave rise to the Cybermen, beings who replaced their organic weaknesses with cybernetic strength.\n\nThese cybernetic warriors are the product of relentless pursuit of survival and perfection. Stripping away their biological frailties, the Cybermen have embraced a unified purpose - to upgrade and assimilate all life forms, ensuring the supremacy of their cold, calculating logic.\n\nThroughout countless battles, the Cybermen have continuously adapted, upgrading their capabilities to counter any resistance. Each encounter with other civilizations has been an opportunity to evolve, incorporating new technologies and strategies into their relentless march forward.\n\nNow, as they prepare to expand their dominion across the galaxy, the Cybermen stand as a testament to the power of technological evolution. Every world they encounter will face the same ultimatum - upgrade or be deleted. The age of the Cybermen has dawned, and the universe will witness the rise of a relentless, cybernetic empire. The question that remains is - who will dare to stand against them?"

 START_SCREEN_WHONIVERSE_CYBERIAD:0 "The Cyberiad represents the pinnacle of Cyberman evolution, a shared consciousness that unites all Cyber-units in a hive mind of unparalleled efficiency and collective intelligence. Emerging from the remnants of the Cybermen of Mondas and Pete's World, the Cyberiad has inherited the strengths of both ancestors, creating a new breed of weapons-grade Cybermen.\n\nHaving fought in the brutal Cyber-Wars against humanity's empire, the Cyberiad continually adapted. The conflict culminated in humanity destroying the Tiberian spiral galaxy, seemingly ending the Cyberiad's threat.\n\nYet, the Cybermen endured. Beneath the surface of Hedgewick's World of Wonders, they survived, kidnapping guests to repair damaged units and construct a new Cyber-Planner. Soon the humans left the planet, not realizing that it had become the new home of the Cybermen.\n\nNow, the Cyberiad stands ready to rise again. From the shadows of Hedgewick's World of Wonders, they will rebuild their legions and expand into the galaxy. Every world they encounter will face the might of the Cyberiad. The era of Cyberman resurgence has begun, and the question remains - who will dare to stop them?"

You don't know whose children are going to scream and burn! How many hearts will be broken! How many lives shattered! How much blood will spill until everybody does what they were always going to have to do from the very beginning. Sit down and talk!"\n\nAfter the Doctor's speech, Kate decides to stand down.

The §HZygon§! splinter group interprets this as a last-ditch trick by the humans, while §HUNIT§! forces are thrown into disarray. Mistrust and panic escalate quickly, sparking violent confrontations.\n\nWithout the deterrent effect of the Osgood Boxes, open warfare breaks out. Global military forces, fearing an uncontrollable Zygon uprising, launch pre-emptive strikes. The Zygon insurgents, feeling betrayed and cornered, retaliate with full force. The conflict rapidly spirals into a worldwide war marked by ruthless tactics and heavy casualties on both sides.\n\nAs the violence spreads, coordinated military operations aim to eradicate Zygon populations entirely. The fighting is intense and widespread, leading to a brutal genocide. The Zygons are systematically hunted down and eliminated, their communities destroyed in the process. Cities lie in ruins, and the death toll climbs with each passing day.\n\nThe aftermath of this global conflict is grim.

The clergy views Trenzalore with reverence and dread, understanding its fate is tied to the universe's survival. Whispers of an ancient conflict and the rise of the Doctor pervade its ranks.\n\nWithin the Church, the militant Kovarian Chapter, led by the enigmatic Madame Kovarian, has taken a prominent role.
